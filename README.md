# 🛫 Aviation Accident Analysis (EDA)

This project performs a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global aviation accident data. It aims to uncover critical trends, identify recurring causes, and offer actionable insights that can help enhance aviation safety. By visualizing and analyzing patterns, this project helps understand when, where, and why accidents happen.

## 🔍 Objective

The goal is to leverage data science tools to:

- Discover temporal and geographic trends in aviation accidents
- Analyze the most common causes and types of incidents
- Compare fatal vs. non-fatal accidents
- Reveal insights that could aid in policy or design improvements for aviation safety

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy`: Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`: Trend and categorical visualizations
  - `Plotly`: Interactive plots
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter for an interactive, documented workflow

---

## 📈 Highlights

- **Year-wise trend analysis**: Understand if aviation safety is improving
- **Geographic analysis**: Map accident locations and regions with higher risk
- **Phase-of-flight insights**: See when accidents are most likely (takeoff, cruise, landing)
- **Fatality breakdown**: Evaluate which types of crashes result in more casualties
- **Operator analysis**: Spot patterns related to specific airlines or aircraft types

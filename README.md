Overview

This project aims to analyze aviation accident data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. Using data visualization and statistical techniques, the project explores critical factors that contribute to aviation accidents, such as weather conditions, human errors, mechanical failures, and geographical influences.

Objectives
Understand key trends in aviation accident occurrences over time.
Identify the most common causes of aviation accidents.
Visualize geographical hotspots for accidents.
Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain actionable insights.
Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the raw aviation accident dataset for analysis.
Visualization: Graphical representations of trends, patterns, and correlations.
Statistical Analysis: Insights into accident causes, fatalities, and contributing factors.
Geospatial Analysis: Mapping accident locations for spatial trend detection.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computations
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
plotly and folium for interactive geospatial analysis
scikit-learn for statistical modeling
geopandas for advanced geospatial analysis

Usage
Place the raw dataset in the data/raw/ directory.
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform EDA and generate insights.
Visualizations and reports will be saved in the outputs/ directory.
Key Insights (Examples)
The majority of accidents are due to human error, followed by mechanical issues.
Weather conditions play a significant role in a high percentage of accidents.
The geographical analysis indicates accident hotspots near high-traffic airports.
Future Work
Incorporate machine learning models to predict accident severity.
Expand the dataset to include more recent records.
Explore the role of pilot experience and aircraft age in accident rates.
